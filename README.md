CNIT490 Menard's capstone project 2025

# Project Objectives
Our project aims to address the high demand for infrastructure requests associated with various initiatives. Our solution involves automating the process of receiving these requests and efficiently creating the desired environment. Upon a successful request and designation of resources, the environment is dismantled automatically after the user's desired end date.
